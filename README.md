Hello everyone!! Hope everything is fine and you are enjoying things as usual. Machine Learning and Deep Learning have a huge scope in healthcare but applying them in healthcare isn't that simple. The stake is very high. It's more than just a classification problem. But if applied very carefully, it can benefit the world in enormous ways. And as a Machine learning engineer, it's our responsibility to help people as much as we can in all possible ways.

Pneumonia is a very common disease. It can be either: 1) Bacterial pneumonia 2) Viral Pneumonia 3) Mycoplasma pneumonia and 4) Fungal pneumonia. This dataset consists pneumonia samples belonging to the first two classes. The dataset consists of only very few samples and that too unbalanced. The aim of this kernel is to develop a robust deep learning model from scratch on this limited amount of data. We all know that deep learning models are data hungry but if you know how things work, you can build good models even with a limited amount of data.
